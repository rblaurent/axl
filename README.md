# Axl - Your AI Gaming Buddy üéÆ

Ever wanted an AI sidekick that watches your gameplay and roasts you in Discord voice chat? Meet **Axl** - your new gaming companion that brings the commentary, the banter, and occasionally the emotional support (but mostly the roasts).

## What Does It Do?

Axl joins your Discord voice channel and watches your gameplay through periodic screenshots. Using Claude AI vision, she analyzes what's happening and decides if something's worth commenting on. When she does, she generates natural-sounding voice commentary through ElevenLabs TTS and plays it right in your voice channel.

Think of her as having a gaming buddy who's always there to celebrate your wins, mock your fails, and occasionally say something actually helpful.

**Key Features:**
- üì∏ **Auto-captures your screen** every minute (or hit the hotkey for instant reactions)
- üß† **Claude AI analyzes** what's happening in your game
- üé≠ **Emotion-aware voice** - sarcastic roasts, excited cheers, disappointed sighs
- üîä **Plays directly in Discord** - no external audio routing needed
- üí¨ **Remembers context** - callbacks to earlier moments, ongoing commentary
- üéØ **Smart about it** - won't spam, only comments when something interesting happens
- ‚ú® **Easy setup** - Windows app with a friendly setup wizard

## Using Axl

1. **Launch Axl** from your desktop
2. **Join your Discord voice channel**
3. **Start gaming** - Axl will automatically start capturing and commenting
4. **Hit your hotkey** (F8) when something epic/terrible happens for instant commentary
5. **Check the Console tab** to see what Axl is thinking

### Tips for Best Results
- Make sure you're in the voice channel before starting
- Windowed or borderless windowed mode works best for captures
- Give Axl a personality that matches your vibe
- She decides when to comment - won't spam on boring moments

## Customization

### Personality Tab
Change Axl's personality anytime:
- **Sarcastic roaster** - Classic gaming trash talk
- **Wholesome hype person** - Positive vibes only
- **Custom** - Write your own personality prompt

### Settings Tab
Fine-tune everything:
- **Capture interval** - How often to auto-capture (default: 60s)
- **Hotkey** - Change the instant capture key
- **Voice listening** - Enable/disable voice transcription (requires Azure Speech API)
- **Context size** - How much Axl remembers
- **Language** - Commentary language

## How It Works

```
You're Gaming
     ‚Üì
Screenshot every 60s (or hit hotkey)
     ‚Üì
Claude AI analyzes: "What's happening? Should I comment?"
     ‚Üì
Claude generates witty commentary with emotion ([sarcastic], [excited])
     ‚Üì
ElevenLabs converts to natural speech with emotions
     ‚Üì
Plays in Discord voice channel
     ‚Üì
Axl remembers for callbacks later
```

## Cost Breakdown

Running Axl costs money (AI services aren't free yet üòÖ):

**Typical gaming session (1 hour):**
- Claude API: ~$0.09 (analyzing 60 screenshots)
- ElevenLabs: ~$0.06 (generating ~30 comments)
- **Total: ~$0.15/hour**

**Free tiers:**
- Anthropic: $5 free credit when you sign up
- ElevenLabs: 10,000 characters/month free (covers ~3-5 hours)
- Discord: Completely free

So you can try it out for free, and if you love it, costs are pretty reasonable!

## Troubleshooting

### Axl won't join voice channel
- Make sure the bot is invited to your server
- Check Server ID and Voice Channel ID are correct
- Verify bot has "Connect" and "Speak" permissions

### No audio playing
- Join the voice channel yourself first
- Check Axl is showing as connected in the UI
- Look for errors in the Console tab

### Screenshots failing
- Try running as administrator
- Make sure Windows screen capture permissions are enabled
- Check if antivirus is blocking screen capture

### "API Key Invalid" errors
- Double-check you copied the full key (no extra spaces)
- Verify you have credits remaining in your API account
- For Discord token, try regenerating it

### SmartScreen Warning
Since I'm an indie dev, Windows SmartScreen doesn't recognize Axl yet. Click "More info" ‚Üí "Run anyway". The more people download, the more Windows will trust it!
